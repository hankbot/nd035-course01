Project: SuperDuperDrive

In this project, students will use the skills acquired in the first course to build a web-based personal storage application: SuperDuperDrive!

Students will implement user-facing features like file, note and secure credential storage with industry-standard, full-stack development tools. Building on Spring Boot as a base, students will use Spring MVC and Thymeleaf to build a Java-backed web app. Using H2 as an inmemory database, students will store user data with MyBatis, a deadsimple ORM library and secure that data from unauthorized access with Spring Security. Finally, to round out the development cycle and verify that the app is feature-complete, students will implement a series of automated user tests with JUnit and Selenium.
